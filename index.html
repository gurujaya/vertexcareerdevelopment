                        Many aspiring students from around the world hope to study and work in America, but are unsure how to start.  Despite their aspirations, many encounter difficulties navigating the complex landscape of educational opportunities. 
                        41% of graduate international students worry about their future employment-based visas. Teaching them the necessary skills can enable them to be more confident.
